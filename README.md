# CS50Rust


 The follwing repository is a repository designed to help myself learn [Rust proframming langauage](https://www.rust-lang.org/). In order to achieve this I am implementing the problem sets found within [Harvards *CS50P*](https://cs50.harvard.edu/python/2022/psets/)  

# Notes to self
When creating rust scripts use 
```
cargo new PROBLEMSET
``` 
 This will genrate a main.rs file that will run when input 

```
cargo run 
```
 # Problem set 0
 ## Functions/Variables
 - Indoor Voice
 - Playback speed
 - Making Faces
 - Einstein
 - Tip Calculator
